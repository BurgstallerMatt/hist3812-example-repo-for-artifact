# Process Notes

So starting to use the scann3D has been an interesting experience
nto sure why but the picture kept on adding extra eyes to the scan
tried taking out some of the blurry pictures, but that didn't work out very well at all
still not sure what is wrong with it

- Started work on 3d project today Tuesday 16th
- took pictures of Terry Fox statue in front of parliament hill
- had to get on Matt's shoulders to take some of the higher pictures, hopefully they turn out well
- weather was a bit crappy out, little bits of blowing snow, and a bit cloudy, could end up affecting the overal image

Regard3D
- Terry Fox File
- TRied adding photo set
- opens other window was hidden behind
- selected all and added
- picture set name Terry Fox
- Unknown focal length for far too pictures, try using pictures with better focal lengths

Picture set, recognizes camera make and model, but not sensors, had to add in the sensors by googling the sensors for phone
sensors were 4.69 X 3.52 mm or 0.23 inches (5.8 mm)
Tried changing the focal point and sensory width to make it work
- nothing changed

Starting over
file place
/Users/johnw/Documents/test4/test4.r3d
- retried adding the picture set again, still did not work, came up with the same warning
- changed Motorola to motorola, see if uppercase lower cchanges
- changes still did not work

changing metadata, using exiftool, google search it phil harvey

if having problems on mac, click control, then click open

electricarchaeology.ca Shawns personal website

Shawn does computer type commmands to try and change the senors, it doesnt work

tried changing things through multiple different ways, still not showing up as changes through regard3D

trying to use submlime text, it is a text editor, shows you precisely what is on a file,
Excel is by microsoft and it is the devil, they were adding some form of little info which we could not see
we copied the model number and info directly, and it finally showed the sensory width 
Computing the picture matches
- takes a long time
- finally worked after 27 minutes
compute matches
- wait more
- TRiangulate, we decided to try Global triangulation because it fit our setting needs (used the came camera and same amount of zoom)
- we realized at this point that it was not showing us an image that we wanted, went back tmo computing the pictures, and changed the keypoint sensitivity and keypoint matching ratio to ultra
- may need to edit pictures
- ended up having to leave because it was taking too long, was at 30 minutes and looked like only 50% loaded

- went home and used Paint to get rid of the background images of the file
- saved files should work better on regard3D next time hopefully

Jan 22
- Users/marcbitar/Documents/Terry/Terry.r3d
going through the command terminal
  - ls for list
  - cd for change directory
  - make: new
  - Camera model: XT1650
  - Focal l;ength 3.7 mm
- sensors 5.8 mm
had to change the settings, the commands used are on shawns website 
https://electricarchaeology.ca/2018/01/20/3d-models-from-archival-film-video-footage/ step 2
Compute matches
  - ultra settings for all
 Triangulate
  - used incremental structure from Motion
  Densification
  - Used CMVS/PMVS and preset settings, then tried chagning settings level 0 Cells size 1 Threshold 0.79 wsize 8 min num image 3
  Create Surface
 - Tried one with texture and one with colour (thing) the one with colour seemed to look better
 - exported it
 - then went back to try and play with some of the pictures
- took too long, so had to stop and export the primary image

Opened up Meshlab
- Opened up the new 3D rendering that had been produced
- getting rid of the extra bits around the image
- Used the select vertexes tool, dragged around what i didn't want
- then used the tool "delete the current set of selected vertices" button
- repeated until had gotten rid of everything didnt want
- with the new image that was produced the file was saved as a .ply file
- tried uploading to sketchfab
- file uploaded but there were parts of the image that were missing
- not sure eactly what occured
- tried using the file in a different format and exported as an .obj file
- same problem occured
- i hate sketchfab currently
- tried again and the file now has a colourful background
- where did the colour come from
- still hate sketchfab
- able to upload an image that is just a blank model of the image with no colour, still shows texture though
- need more time to try and figure out how to upload it without losing parts of the model

Trying Meshlab again
- used the first version of the model from Regard3D
- repeated same steps to remove excess dots around image
- exported mesh as .obj file
- moved the previous .obj and .mtl files out of the folder, and put in seperate folder
- zipped the folder with the new .obj file in it
- upload to meshlab
- no more weird missing colour patches
- i hate meshlab less now

new model
- there are parts of the model missing, from when cleaning up the random dots
- will need to figure out how to attach everything together for next module when looking more into 3D printing

# meshmixer
- thought about what we could do to change our object, and decided changing terry's legs would be an interesting way to go about it. 
- thought a centaur would be an interesting way of transforming him, so now we transforms
- start off filling some of the wholes in Terry image
- step 1: edit- make solid
- step 2: change "solid type" to sharp edge preserve
- seems to have filled in all the holes from the original model, no more gaps between legs and in head, no more colour though, just the shading
- find model to remix with
- download "Arabian Horse" from sketchfab
- try to figure out how to put the two models together
- open "arabien horse" in meshmixer
- import terry file
- select upper body of terry object
- turn object to solid seperate part
- delete full terry image
- go to "mesh mix" and select "my part"
- select the torso of Terry and drag onto screen
- adjust it accordingly to give image of a centaur. where horses head is
- select the part of the horse that is behind terry's torso
- once selected, use the delete key to get rid of it
- select both of the objects in the object window and then "combine" them using the edit toolbar

# module 3

# Twinery Game
- game about terry and the horse becoming the centaur in the end
- using sugarcube
- game starts
- player given either horse or terry character using either function (https://twinery.org/wiki/function)
- Gives story for the two options after given, using historical facts and other such things to progress the story
- following the terry story, trying to go chronologically with his life
- using basic commands"[[insert name of next/previous slide]]" to get the story to move forward or backwards in the sequence.
- created link to begining passage when you die, using code script found here https://blogs.stockton.edu/textscape/files/2015/04/A-Twine-Cheat-Sheet.pdf under the "Creating a link that differ..." section
- attempted to try and use a key in the game to make it so that your positive decisions would end up giving you a better outcome
- the coding kept on giving me errors saying it was not identified and such, even when i copied the info directly from the guide http://www.adamhammond.com/twineguide/
-decide to scrap using the key all together
- making a strange story for the horse
- come to an option where you must choose head or tailhttps://twinery.org/wiki/function using the either function
- set it up so it randomly chooses one when you make your choice 
- depending on what you chose your answer will be right or wrong, and thus you get sent to the corresponding spot
- Continue story to end it off with either losing or getting to the final objective
- export the file and upload using philome.la

# module 4

# 3D printing Terry the Centaur
- open up obj file in 3D Builder
- Re-save file as .stl file
- send to carleton university discovery centre for printing
- pick up from printing
- remove extra 3D printed parts
- the end
