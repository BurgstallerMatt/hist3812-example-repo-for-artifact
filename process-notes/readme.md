January 16, 2018: My parter Marc and I traveled to downtown Ottawa to take pictures of the Terry Fox Statue that we would use to make a 3D model.

Marc and I brushed off as much snow as we could, but that the light snow that had been falling might have created a problem with theclarity of the pictures.

The first 30 pictures that I took were of too low of an angle and did not capture the upper details of the statue.

To get a better viewpoint, Marc got on my shoulders and he was able to take pictures that showcased the statue entirely.

Marc took around 50 pictures of the Terry Fox Statue from the better angle on top of my shoulders.


January 17, 2018:  Met with Professor Graham in the Underhill Computer Lab to use the software Regard 3D in order to attempt to create a digital model.

Regard 3D was slow to open at first.

We created the file named Terry Fox file.

Marc transfered the photo files from his phone onto a USB stick and uploaded them to the computer (this took some time).

Once the files had been loaded, the computer informed us that the file information for the camera make, camera model, focal length and sensor size were unknown; therefore the images could not be processed by Regard 3D. 

We found the camera make and model on Marc's phone (camera make: motorola and camera model: xt1650).

We googled the camera make and model to find the information of the focal length (3.68mm) and sensor size (5.8mm) 

We added the information to the file and reloaded the picture set.

It didn't change anything.  We started over. 

We uploaded new picture file with file name as Terry Fox1.

We re-added the information and found out that we had entered a lower case "m' instead of an upper case "M" for the camera model information that was preventing the software from processing the file information. Added new camera make (Motorola). 

Reloaded picture set and the file information for sensor size and focal length were still not available.

Installed Exif Tool to manually change the information on the file. 

Exif Tool would not open at first due to security reasons.  We had to control click to bypass the security check and open Exif Tool. 

We used Exif Tool to manually change the focal length but we were not able to change the sensor size. 

Turned the computer off and then turned it back on. 

Repeated same process and used Sublime Text Editor to see what was exactly displayed in the file.

We Copied the camera model (xt1650) and pasted it into the file information slot, and then added the sensor width (5.8mm). 

Everything was displayed! It Worked! (sort of)

We clicked on compute matches and waited for Regard 3D to load... The result was a 3D image of 5 tiny square points. 

We set match points to ultra and waited for Regard 3D to load once more.

It took too long to load and we figured that the background in our pictures was confusing the software.

We decided to try again another day.
