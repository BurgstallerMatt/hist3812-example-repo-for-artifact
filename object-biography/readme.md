# Object Biography

In this readme file, you explain the context and background for your object. Think of this as being rather like a wikipedia page giving the basic particulars of the object/site/building/whatever that you have modeled. It should be complete enough that I understand why your object matters, and could find more information if I want.

Use Harvard author-date system for citations, as that works better with plain text than trying to figure out footnotes (footnotes are a hangover from an industrial model of text preparation).



The Government of Canada issued the construction of the Terry Fox Statue in 1983 by artist John Hooper and was originally unveiled on September 17 of that year at the intersection of Wellington Street and Colonel By Drive.  On July 1, 1998, as part of the Path of Heroes initiative that was created to commemorate the national heroes of Canada, the Terry Fox Statue was relocated to 90 Wellington Street in front of the Parliament Buildings.
